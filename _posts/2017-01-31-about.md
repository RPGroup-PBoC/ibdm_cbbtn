# Cell Biology by the Numbers at IBDM

## About

This intensive week long mini-course explores the way that physical and
mathematical models can be used to understand biological systems. The course
begins by examining the way in which simple order of magnitude estimates can be
used to provide insights into problems ranging from the fidelity of protein
translation to how far a bird can fly without stopping to how amphibians arrive
on oceanic islands. This is followed by the use of statistical mechanics to
explore problems in regulatory biology. Some examples include the physics of
post-translational modifications, how cells make transcriptional decisions and
the precision with which embryonic development takes place. From there, we turn
to the biophysics of membranes and how order is maintained in the context of
two-dimensional arrangements of lipids and proteins. The final topic explores
ideas from evolution, population genetics and information theory in order to get a sense of the transmission of biological information. In addition to these
topics, the course also involves an intensive hands-on project using Python to
do image segmentation in order to find the fluorescence of individual cells and
to use this fluorescence to compare to statistical mechanical models of gene
regulation.


## Where and When? 

The course will take place in XXX from 4 November through 10
November.
