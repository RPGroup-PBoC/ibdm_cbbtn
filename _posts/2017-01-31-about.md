# Cell Biology by the Numbers at IBDM

## About

This intensive week long mini-course explores the way that physical and
mathematical models can be used to understand biological systems. The course
begins by examining the way in which simple order of magnitude estimates can be
used to provide insights into problems ranging from the fidelity of protein
translation to how far a bird can fly without stopping to how amphibians arrive
on oceanic islands. This is followed by the use of statistical mechanics to
explore problems in regulatory biology. Some examples include the physics of
post-translational modifications, how cells make transcriptional decisions and
the precision with which embryonic development takes place. In addition to these topics, the course also involves a series of hands-on projects using Python to amplify the case studies discussed in class.


## Where and When? 

The course will take place from 5 November through 10
November.
